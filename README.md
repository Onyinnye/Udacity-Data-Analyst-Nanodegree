# Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree
These are all the projects I did for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

# Project 1: - Global Weather Trends
In this Project, I analysed the local and global temperature data and compared the global temperature trends to the temperature trend of my city

# Project 2: Investigate a Dataset (No_show_Appointment)
in this project, I analysed the No-show Appointment dataset which is available in kaggle. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. it includes information on the Patient ID, Appointment day, sheduled day, Gender, Age, Sms recieved, No show etc.. The data set can help to understand why patients missed their appointment and the possibility of showing up for appointments I focused on answering the following question

1. the age group that showed up more for the apppointment
2. The gender that showed up more for the appointment
3. Relationship between the sickness and response to the appointmennt
4. The neighbourhood that showed up the most
** after cleaning, exploring and analysing the data, I came up with the following conclusions:
- Of those patients who have showed up for appointment, majority of the age group within 20 to 40 did not show up for the appointment when compared to age groups 0-20, 40-60 and 60 plus. of these 20 to 40 age group, Female patients were not present for appoinments a compared with male of similar age group.
- Hypertension and Diabetes Patients within the age group 40 - 80 were present for appointment and female patients were mostly present
- Male Alcoholism patients were bigger especially the 40- 70 agge groups and were present than the female although female patients from the age group 40- 50 had more alcoholics than females in of the same age groups
- SMS and Sholarship didn,t really seem to improve the rsponseof patients for appointments
- Majority of the visits happend from Jardim Camburi, but there was not much information to further explore reasons why it is so. the most logicl eplaination is that majority of the patients reside in the neighbourhood
### I particularly enjoyed this project because I got mind blowing commendations from my reviewer which I'll be sharing with you ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ
