# Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree
These are all the projects I did for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

# Project 1: - Global Weather Trends
In this Project, I analysed the local and global temperature data and compared the global temperature trends to the temperature trend of my city

# Project 2: Investigate a Dataset (No_show_Appointment)
in this project, I analysed the No-show Appointment dataset which is available in kaggle. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. it includes information on the Patient ID, Appointment day, sheduled day, Gender, Age, Sms recieved, No show etc.. The data set can help to understand why patients missed their appointment and the possibility of showing up for appointments I focused on answering the following question

1. the age group that showed up more for the apppointment
2. The gender that showed up more for the appointment
3. Relationship between the sickness and response to the appointmennt
4. The neighbourhood that showed up the most
  after cleaning, exploring and analysing the data, I came up with the following conclusions:
- Of those patients who have showed up for appointment, majority of the age group within 20 to 40 did not show up for the appointment when compared to age groups 0-20, 40-60 and 60 plus. of these 20 to 40 age group, Female patients were not present for appoinments a compared with male of similar age group.
- Hypertension and Diabetes Patients within the age group 40 - 80 were present for appointment and female patients were mostly present
- Male Alcoholism patients were bigger especially the 40- 70 agge groups and were present than the female although female patients from the age group 40- 50 had more alcoholics than females in of the same age groups
- SMS and Sholarship didn,t really seem to improve the rsponseof patients for appointments
- Majority of the visits happend from Jardim Camburi, but there was not much information to further explore reasons why it is so. the most logicl eplaination is that majority of the patients reside in the neighbourhood
### I particularly enjoyed this project because I got mind blowing commendations from my reviewer which I'll be sharing with you ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ

# Project 3: Analyze_A_B Test Analysis
In this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by a hypothetical e-commerce website. The analysis is a standard statistical z-test to compare two populations as well as a numerically simulated version of the statistical z-test. Finally, a logistic regression is run to see if the new page outperforms the old page in terms of probability of converting the visitor to a customer.
# Project 4: Data Wrangling
 In this project, I analysed the WeRateDogs twitter account. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc." WeRateDogs has over 8.9M followers (on February 2020) and has received international media coverage. The account also has a branded game, a popular online store, and a book that was published in Fall, 2017.
- I Wrangled WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for the analyses and visualizations.
- I particularly found this project challenging as I got the highest review to make some adjustments, but what is life without hurdles ðŸ˜ƒ....The most important thing is not to let the hurdles stop you as I did with this project ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ

# Project 5 : Communicating data findings
In this Project, I explored the Loan data set from propsper contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate)current loan status, borrower income, and many others which was trimmed down to 76,224 loans and 21 vaiables the features of interest include BorrowerState, IncomeVerifiable, Occupation,EmploymentStatus,BorrowerRate, IsBorrowerHomeowner, ListingCategory_Numeric,Recommendations, MonthlyLoanPayment, LoanOriginalAmount,LoanOriginationDate, LoanStatus, DebtToIncomeRatio, IncomeRange, ProsperScore, StatedMonthlyIncome, PercentFunded to know how  different variables in the dataset affect granting and recieving loan.
- I explored and cleaned the data
- I explained the data usin matplotlib and Seaborne for my visualizations
- This Project was my next favorite as I told a story with the dataset and also got an awesome review from the reviewer which of course I shared with Y'all ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ
