    "- I converted timestamp which was in the string format to the datetime format\n",
    "- I removed the underscores from the dog breeds and removed the inconsistency in the name format which was a mixture of both lower and upper case\n",
    "- I removed the \"><\" from the source column so that the information would be properly extracted\n",
    "- I made all rows in the rating_denominator 10 to remove row information that contained >10 or <10 since 10 is the only rating denominator \n",
    "- I converted the ratings_denominators that are in decimal to float datatype\n",
    "- Rename Columns(p1,p2,p3,p1_dog,p2_dog,p3_dog,p1_conf,p2_conf,p3_conf)to improve clarity\n",

    "- retweeted_status_user_id, and retweeted_status_timestamp columns which had so much missing rows as they wonâ€™t give accurate results if analysed \n",
